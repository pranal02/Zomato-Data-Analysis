# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Objective:

This project aims to analyze Zomato dataset to gain insights into restaurant trends, user behavior, and business performance.

Data Transformation:

Rate Column Replacement:

             Replaced /5 values in the rate column  to ensure consistency.

Null Value Check:

             Verified for the presence of null values in the dataset and handled them appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).
Data Analysis:

Restaurant Type Distribution:

           Used seaborn's countplot to visualize the distribution of restaurant types.

Votes per Restaurant Type:

          Created a line graph to compare the number of votes received by different restaurant types.

Rate Distribution:

          Employed a histogram to analyze the distribution of restaurant ratings.

Average Spend by Couple:

            Utilized countplot to visualize the average spending per couple at different restaurant types.

Online vs. Offline Purchases:

            Differentiated between online and offline purchases using box plots.

Restaurant Type vs. Online Orders:

            Created a heatmap to explore the relationship between restaurant types and the frequency of online orders.

Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.

Seaborn: For statistical visualizations.
